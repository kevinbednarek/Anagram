This is the anagram problem. There are 3 solutions that are defined as 3 separate methods.

1: Hashmap approach
2: Sorting approach
3: counting approach

There are descriptions written as comments over the last two methods explaining how they function and their time complexity.

I haven't been able to come up with an elegant solution on how to simplify the hashmap approach. There is a lot of repeated code and multiple hashmaps,
so it is not very space efficient.
